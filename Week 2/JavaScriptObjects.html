<h2>The first of the two examples above is accessed by the whatever.whatever method. And the second is 
    accessed by the whatever["whatever"] method. I could also delete whatever was in a specific element
    but I don't think I need to show you that.

<h3 id = "hello"></h3>
<h3 id = "Hello"></h3>
<h2>This text was manipulated using methods to uppercase and to lowercase(I used the HELLO WORLD text and turned it lower case.)</h2><br>

<script>
    var message = "hello world";
    var x = message.toUpperCase();

    document.getElementById("hello").innerHTML = x;
